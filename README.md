I'm Christian Hoyos Salazar, 21 years old, a Systems Engineer and Front-end Developer passionate about transforming ideas into functional and engaging digital experiences. I'm motivated by creating platforms that improve the efficiency of business processes, always taking into account user experience and code quality.

I have completed several courses at Platzi and a Diploma in Artificial Intelligence, which has allowed me to strengthen my technical skills and explore the impact of AI on web development.

Beyond coding, I consider myself a young man with energy, creativity, and a clear goal of contributing to the digital world with practical and scalable solutions.
